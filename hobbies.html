        <p style="text-align: center">Good job on finding this one! These are the hobbies I'm currently pursuing as of '24. Some of them are wild, I'd like to say. Have fun perusing this page!</p>

            <h2>Ice Skating</h2>
            <p>This one surprised me. Most recently, I've picked up ice skating as a result of being Miyagi'd during an impulse stop at the WEM Ice Palace. Just gotta figure out how to stop now!</p>

            <h2>Sewing</h2>
            <p>Being this size means a lot of clothes get worn down quite faster than expected. I picked up a needle for a Home Economics class back in fifth grade, and while I never completely remembered everything, I still try.</p>

            <h2>Working Out</h2>
            <p>What a surprise, right? I paid some schmuck a total of a thousand dollars, I believe, for an entire six months worth of personal training in the gym I go to. Was it worth it? Probably not. But it did put me in the right direction and mindset on how I would go about doing things in the gym. Do I follow it all the time? No. :)</p>

            <h2>Biking</h2>
            <p>I've learned to bike when I was 15. Quite late, you'd imagine. But it's never too late to learn. Some of the rips on my jacket happened because I wiped out on my bike. It's fun pretending you're in a music video and suddenly snapping the front wheel away from the road.</p>

            <h2>Games</h2>
            <p>Do you even have to ask? The first game I remember ever playing was <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_Set_Radio_Future" target="_blank" class="hidden">Jet Set Radio Future</a></strong> on the original Xbox. It was a hell of a time, not knowing how to play a game and wondering how I kept losing. Probably also what started my anger issues. From then, it was a back-and-forth between PCs from computer caf&eacute;s and whatever console was 'borrowed' by my family.</p>
