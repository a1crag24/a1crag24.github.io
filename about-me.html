            <hr>
            <p>I am <strong>a1crag24</strong>, also known as <strong>Reynel</strong>. If you're in NAIT since '23, you've probably seen a fat kid in a blue and white jacket.</p>
            <p><span class="lineu">That's me!</span> Don't be afraid to say hello, because I am!</p>
            <p>
                As of 2024, I'm attending as a Game Programming student in the first year.
                I figured to get back into school again to put myself to work onto something I'm even half-interested in so I could see if it <em>is</em> something I want to do.
            </p>
            <p>Even as a kid, I've had delusions of making games ever since I was in the 3rd grade. Didn't act on it until the 6th grade, where I started making Minecraft Pocket Editions mods on JavaScript. <em><strong>Yes, I have too many grey hairs for my age.</strong></em></p>
            <p>I got more experience from learning HTML later on around the 7th grade which helped me cement what you see around the site right now.</p>
            <p>Other than those main ones, most of my experience has purely been theoretical: game farming scripts, more game mods, little things.</p>
            <p><a href="hobbies.html" class="hidden">I may know a lot of things</a>, but I'm not an expert yet! As they say, <em>"jack of all trades, master of none, but better than a master of one".</em></p>
